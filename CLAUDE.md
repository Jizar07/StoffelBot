# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project: Stoffel Bot

This appears to be a new project directory. As the codebase develops, this file should be updated with:

1. **Build and Development Commands** - Once established, include commands for:
   - Installing dependencies
   - Running the bot
   - Testing functionality
   - Linting and formatting

2. **Architecture Overview** - To be documented as the bot's structure emerges

## Notes

- This is currently an empty project directory
- Update this file as the codebase grows with specific architectural decisions and command patterns
